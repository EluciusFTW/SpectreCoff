# FSharp Spectre.Console Template

This repository contains a small, ready-to-go starting point for developing a console application in F#, using the [Spectre.Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console) library.

Spectre.Console uses _commands_ together with _settings_ to create strongly typed bindings to console arguments. It also provides help and documentation and default values in a simple manner.

This sample contains one command, _greet_, to which you can provide your name (using `-n|--name`) as a parameter:

```PS
dotnet run greet -n "John"
````

Feel free to clone it and start your application from here!
